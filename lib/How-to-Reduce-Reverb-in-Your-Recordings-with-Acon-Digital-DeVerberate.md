# How to Reduce Reverb in Your Recordings with Acon Digital DeVerberate
 
Reverb is a natural phenomenon that occurs when sound waves reflect off surfaces and create a sense of space and depth. Reverb can enhance the quality and realism of your recordings, but it can also cause problems if it is too much or unwanted. For example, reverb can make vocals sound muddy, distant, or echoey, or it can interfere with the clarity and intelligibility of speech.

Fortunately, there is a way to reduce or remove reverb from your recordings using a plugin called Acon Digital DeVerberate[^1^]. DeVerberate is a plugin that can attenuate or boost the reverberation that is already present in recorded material[^2^]. It works by analyzing the direct and reverberant components of the sound and allowing you to adjust their balance and characteristics.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use DeVerberate to reduce reverb in your recordings and improve their quality and clarity. We will also share some tips and tricks to get the best results with this plugin.
 
## How to Use DeVerberate to Reduce Reverb
 
To use DeVerberate to reduce reverb in your recordings, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install DeVerberate from Acon Digital's website[^2^]. DeVerberate is available for PC and Macintosh and supports the VST, VST3, AAX and AU plug-in formats. Both 32 bit and 64 bit versions are available.
2. Open your audio editor or DAW and load the recording that you want to process with DeVerberate. You can use DeVerberate on any type of audio material, such as vocals, speech, instruments, or sound effects.
3. Insert DeVerberate as an effect on the track or channel that contains the recording. You can also use it as a send effect if you want to apply it to multiple tracks at once.
4. Adjust the parameters of DeVerberate to reduce the reverb in your recording. The main parameters are:
    - **Reverb Time:** This controls how long the reverb tail lasts. A shorter reverb time means less reverb. You can use the automatic mode to let DeVerberate estimate the reverb time from the input signal, or you can use the manual mode to set it yourself.
    - **Dry Level:** This controls how loud the direct sound is. The direct sound is the sound that reaches the microphone without any reflections. A higher dry level means more direct sound and less reverb.
    - **Reverb Level:** This controls how loud the reverberant sound is. The reverberant sound is the sound that reaches the microphone after bouncing off surfaces. A lower reverb level means less reverberant sound and less reverb.
    - **Stereo Width:** This controls how wide or narrow the stereo image of the reverberant sound is. A wider stereo width means more spaciousness and depth, while a narrower stereo width means more focus and clarity.
5. Use the bypass button to compare the processed and unprocessed signals. You can also use the output meter to monitor the level of the output signal and avoid clipping or distortion.
6. Save or export your recording with the reduced reverb.

## Tips and Tricks for Using DeVerberate
 
Here are some tips and tricks for using DeVerberate effectively:

- Use headphones or monitor speakers to listen to your recordings while using DeVerberate. Avoid using laptop speakers or earbuds as they may not reproduce the reverb accurately.
- Use a noise gate or a noise reduction plugin before DeVerberate if your recording has background noise or hiss. This will help DeVerberate focus on the reverb and not on the noise.
- Use a compressor or a limiter after DeVerberate if your recording has low volume or dynamic range. This will help balance the level of your recording and make it louder and more consistent.
- Use a parametric EQ after DeVerberate if your recording has unwanted frequencies or resonances. This will help 0f148eb4a0
