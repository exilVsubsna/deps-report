Tape Piano is not the only plugin that offers a lo-fi piano sound. There are some other alternatives that you can try, such as LABS Tape Piano by Spitfire Audio, which is a free plugin that features a modern upright piano processed with vintage tape machines. It also has some tape loops, echoes and a magnetic card reader for some extra effects. However, Tape Piano by Thenatan has more presets, layers and textures than LABS Tape Piano, and also has a lower CPU usage.
